# Cantodao Interface

This repo contains the front-end interface for Cantodao, a DAO system built on Canto network.
https://github.com/lumtis/cantodao

The interface uses React, Chakra UI, and wagmi libraries.

## Commands

Run interface locally:

```
yarn dev
```

Running the dev command will automatically connects to the local network. To use Canto testnet, you can build and start the app in production:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```
